## Introduction

The HolyGrail Full Stack Application demonstrates the integration of React (front-end library), Express (Node.js framework), and Redis (in-memory database). This project highlights how to create a scalable and high-performance web application using these technologies.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **Redis**: An open-source, in-memory key-value store known for its high performance and versatility.

## Features
- Efficient data caching with Redis
- Responsive and dynamic user interface built with React
- RESTful API endpoints for server-client communication

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.x or later)
- **npm**: Node package manager comes with Node.js
- **Docker**: [Download and install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- **Git**: [Download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Setup

#### Running Redis via Docker

To run Redis using Docker, execute the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 6379:6379 -it redis/redis-stack-server:latest
```

This command will start a Redis container and map port 6379 on your host to port 6379 on the container.

#### Install Node.js Redis Client

In your project directory, you need to install the `redis` package to connect to Redis from your Node.js server:

```bash
npm install redis
```

Ensure you include the necessary Redis configuration in your `.env` file (or equivalent configuration) for both the server and client.

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Redis server** using the Docker command mentioned above.

2. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

## Usage

- **Real-time Updates**: Utilize the application’s real-time capabilities for live data updates.
- **Caching**: Experience improved performance with Redis caching.

## Folder Structure

- **/public**: Contains the React front-end application.
  

- **./index.js**: Contains the Express back-end application.
